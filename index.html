          <h3><p>The concept of football migrated from England to Europe and over the Atlantic. Around 1874, August Hermann and Konrad Koch, two teachers, brought the game to Germany. Meanwhile, it's believed that immigrants introduced soccer to the country. In England, the first football association was established in 1863. The original word for soccer was futbol, but after the Americans discovred it they decided to name it soccer. Numerous countries including Belgium, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland decided to make an association called "FIFA" which is the offical futbol association. After that the story line for futbol was created and it is considered one of the most beautiful piece of art. </p></h3>

            <h2><p>The person your seeing on the left is my biggest inspiration. His name is Cristiano Ronaldo he has thought me how to play the game and how to love, since the age of 4. Cristiano showed me how soccer is a way of life and when playing it, it allows to be free and calm. Like others, I've had to overcome problems throughout my life. Cristano personality was the reason I was able to overcome all of my problems. He is the guy who transformed me into the person who I am today, including being more confident and brave when facing different situation. His role in the futbol community will always be appreciated by me and every person who's supported him on his journey to becoming the greatest footballer (G.O.A.T). I will always be gratful for everything he has done for me. VAMOS CRISTIANO!!!ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹</p></h3>

          <h6><p>With 77 goals in 92 games, PelÃ© is tied for the most goals scored by a Brazilian. He was Santos' all-time leading scorer at the club level with 643 goals in 659 games. Maldini guided Santos to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores as well as the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup during a successful period for the team. He is recognised as one of history's finest defenders. He was known as "Il Capitano" for many years while serving as the Milan and Italy captain ("The Captain"). With 647 appearances, Maldini held the record for the most in Serie A until Gianluigi Buffon passed him in 2020. If we looked at both there stats it will singlehandedly show why they are considered as icons.</p></h6>
